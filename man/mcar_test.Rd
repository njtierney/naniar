\title{Little's missing completely at random (MCAR) test}
\usage{
mcar_test(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble()}} with one row and four columns:
\item{statistic}{Chi-squared statistic for Little's test}
\item{df}{Degrees of freedom used for chi-squared statistic}
\item{p.value}{P-value for the chi-squared statistic}
\item{missing.patterns}{Number of missing data patterns in the data}
}
\description{
Use Little's (1988) test statistic to assess if data is missing completely
at random (MCAR). The null hypothesis in this test is that the data is
MCAR, and the test statistic is a chi-squared value. The example below
shows the output of \code{mcar_test(airquality)}. Given the high statistic
value and low p-value, we can conclude the \code{airquality} data is not
missing completely at random.
